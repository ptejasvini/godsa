## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to solving DSA problems from various platforms. Each solution is implemented in a clean and efficient manner, with detailed comments and explanations.

## Platforms

We are solving problems from the following platforms:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)

## Solutions

Here are some of the problems we have solved:

### LeetCode

- [Two Sum](./leetcode/arrays/twosum.go)
- [Add Two Numbers](./leetcode/linkedlists/addtwonumbers.go)

### HackerRank

- [Array Manipulation](./hackerrank/arrays/arraymanipulation.go)
- [New Year Chaos](./hackerrank/arrays/newyearchaos.go)

### Codeforces

- [Problem 1](./codeforces/problem1.go)
- [Problem 2](./codeforces/problem2.go)

## How to Run

To run any of the solutions, navigate to the respective directory and use the `go run` command. For example, to run the Two Sum solution:

```sh
go run [twosum.go](http://_vscodecontentref_/2)
